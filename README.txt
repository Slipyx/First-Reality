- Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple RPG game I started after playing a lot of Final Fantasy. So
far all that's possible is moving around a map using grid based movement. Maps
are made in Tiled then edited into a custom map format. The only real data
copied from the TMX file is the CSV layer data. For the collision layer, I
replace 65-71 with 1-7 respectively.
